## Talk material

Our talk *Mass Spectrometry-Based Single-Cell Proteomics Data
Analysis* at [SCP2021](https://single-cell.net/proteomics/scp2021) is
composed of 4 parts:

1. [**What is scp**](./what_is_scp.html) is a general introduction to
   the `scp` package, how test it, and where to find help and more
   information.

2. [**Handling quantitative proteomics
  features?**](./qfeatures_intro.html) demonstrating the managing of
  quantitative proteomcis features.

3. [**Importing single-cell proteomics data**](./read_scp_data.html)
  explains how to load data as a `QFeatures` object, listing
  requirements and showing a real-case example.

4. [**Data processing with scp**](./scp_processing.html) describes
   some single-cell processing steps.
