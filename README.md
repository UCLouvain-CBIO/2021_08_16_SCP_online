Our presentation *Mass Spectrometry-Based Single-Cell Proteomics Data
Analysis* at [SCP2021](https://single-cell.net/proteomics/scp2021)
(August 16 - 18, 2021, Boston and online) is composed of 4 parts:

1. [What is scp](./what_is_scp.html) is a general introduction to the
   `scp` package, how test it, and where to find help and more
   information.

2. [Handling quantitative proteomics
  features?](./qfeatures_intro.html) demonstrating the managing
  of quantitative proteomcis features.

2. [read single-cell proteomics data](./read_scp_data.html) explains
  how to load data as a `QFeatures` object, listing requirements and
  showing a real-case example.
